This is a separate command-line application within the BTA codebase. It fetches a list of program-pids for update
 objects since its last run. The timestamp of the current run is then persisted to the existing BES Media File Status
  Log - Batch program database. There are command line parameters to override and reset the "last-run" date.


Ok, design

We will query programs that have changed since a given time

We will extract the metadata for each of these programs.

If this is unequal to the existing metadata we have, we will retrancode the file.

Next time, we will have to remember when a program was last updated, and

We need a storage system. This storage system should just store the records we already have
